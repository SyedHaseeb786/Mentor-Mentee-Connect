1 service specifier
2 service providers
3 end user

--> Service Provider 
	. Service provider is one who will full fill the specifications done by the service specifier

--> End User 
	. End user is one who use 
A Service specifier represent the abstraction part 
any with abstact key wordand not having body is called as abstract method 

if you having abstract present or inheritent, you should prefix the class with the abstract keyword
