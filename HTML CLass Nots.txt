Tag Name:
--> To target the element based on tagname itself we have to use tagName selector.
--> The symbol was the tagname itself.

Universal:
--> It will target all the document elements, including body tag.
--> The symbol used is asterisk(*).

Id Name:
--> TO target the elements uniquely we have to use an id name.
-->in css id name can be duplicated also ther is no problem.
--> But once we moved to advanced languages, repetition of id
name will not work. SO it is highly recommended not to use it from now on
--> The symbol used is hash(#).
