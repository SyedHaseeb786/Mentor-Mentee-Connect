What is derived typecasting?
Non primitive type casting is called derived type casting. 

Types of non primitive typecasting 
What is upcasting? And what is the advantage?

What is the disadvantage of Upcasting?
What is a class cast exception?
What is the use of an instance of operator?

>Polymorphism is derived from the Greek origin where poly means many morphism means forms 

>We can define polymorphism as the ability of an object to have members with the same name, but different forms are called polymorphism.

>Based on the binding, we can classify polymorphism into two types, i.e. compile time polymorphism/static binding/ Early Binding/ Dynamic Binding/ Late Binding / Runtime Polymorphism 
>If the binding is done by the compile at compile time for the polymorphism state program is called as compiletime polymorphism 
>During Compile time polymorphism compiler can face 
	. Method overloading
	. Constructure Overloading
	. Variable Shadowing
	. Method Shadowing

-->A class having method in same name but different formal arguments is called as method overloading 
	ex:
what is constructer overloading ?
> A class having constructers with same name but different formal arguments is called as Constructer overloading.
	ex: car()
		{
		
		}
> car(string name)
	{
	}
Variable Shadowing :
--------------------
> IF the super class and the subclass having the variables with same name is called as variable shadowing 
> Variable shadowing is applicable for both static and non static 
> To achieve variable shadowing is a relation is mandatory 

class A{
static int x = 10;
class b extends A {
static int x = 20;
}
class c extends B {
static int x = 30;
psvm (String[]a){
A ref = new B();
B ref2 = new c();
 c ref3 = new c ();
System.out.println(x);
System.out.println(ref1.x);
s.o.p (refe.x)
